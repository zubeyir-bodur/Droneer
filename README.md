# Droneer

Our project aims to create a programming game which will provide a more fun and engaging alternative to old ways of learning programming. In this game, players will program a space drone to engage other drones in combat. They will write the code beforehand in a separate ide-like part of the game and then complete different combat challenges slowly increasing in difficulty.

It will feature a story mode where the player will slowly learn basic concepts of programming, an arena mode where they can test their skills against pre-written drones, and an online mode where they can test their skills against other players. It will also feature an extensive help page where the user can look up basic questions related to the game or programming in general.

# Setup

We did not made any changes on the project since we made the game executable on Eclipse. To run the project, extract the files and open the project in Eclipse (file -> open projects from file system). In project properties, select "java build path" -> "add library" -> "JRE System Library" -> "Alternate JRE" and then the JDK. Click finish and then run DroneerMaster.
